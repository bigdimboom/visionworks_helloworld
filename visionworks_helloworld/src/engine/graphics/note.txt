Vulkan Pipeline Creation steps
1. query instance level extensions and layers from Vulkan System. (Debug callback is et up at here)
2. create vulkan instance with the extensions and layers you need
3. query GPUs from instance and select a good GPU(VkPhyscialDevice) based on the familyQueues it has in the physicalDeviceProperties
4. create a logical device from selected GPU
5. create the swapchain from logical device
6. create renderpass from logical device
7. create depth and stencil resource from logical device
8. create frame buffer with "swap chain", "renderpass" and "depth resource"
